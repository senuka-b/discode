# Getting Started

!!! warning

    Discode is still in beta-development, meaning that the releases are still BETA releases so it may contain bugs or may not work as expected. You can wait till a stable release rolls out or if you wanna try it out, you can install the latest beta release.


First things first, let's install Discode!

## Installation

### Windows

Download the `discode-setup.exe` file from the latest release.

[Download :fontawesome-solid-download:](https://github.com/yetimeh/discode/releases/latest){ .md-button target="_blank" }

Now, run the setup file and follow the instructions.

### Linux & Mac

Not supported yet, but I will try my best to create installers when a  stable version comes out.
